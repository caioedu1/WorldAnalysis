Observations regarding the correlation between GDP per capita and selected indicators.
Note 1:
Life expectancy in countries with the highest GDP per capita is,
on average, 20 years higher than in countries with the lowest GDP.

Note 2:
The Consumer Price Index (CPI) in nations boasting higher GDP levels typically spans from 100 to 120,
whereas countries with lower GDP tend to display a wider range, reaching as high as 1344 in the case of Sudan.

Note 3:
Nations characterized by a lower GDP per capita often exhibit a higher 
average unemployment rate compared to those nations with a higher GDP per capita. 
Nevertheless, it is imperative to acknowledge that numerous countries with low GDP per capita 
maintain an unemployment rate lower than their counterparts with a higher unemployment rate. 
Consequently, it is evident that while GDP per capita may exert an influence on the unemployment rate, 
its impact is not necessarily substantial (though it should be noted that it does exert some influence).

Note 4:
It's evident that countries with higher GDP per capita collect nearly
double the amount of taxes compared to countries with lower GDP per capita.

Note 5:
Countries with higher per capita GDP tend to have lower corporate tax rates,
whereas countries with lower GDP per capita typically impose lower corporate taxes.

Note 6:
Another noteworthy observation is that a majority of countries with the lowest GDP per capita
are located in the African continent, while those with the highest GDP are primarily found in Europe and the West.

Note 7:
It becomes evident that the CPI in nations characterized by the lowest GDP per capita
surpasses that of countries with the highest GDP per capita by a margin exceeding two-fold.
