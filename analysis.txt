Analysis of how GDP per capita are related and influence to some other indicators:

Average life expectancy in countries with higher GDP per capita: 82
Average life expectancy in countries with lower GDP per capita: 62
Average unemployment rate in countries with higher GDP per capita: 4.96%
Average unemployment rate in countries with lower GDP per capita: 5.06%
Average tax revenue percentage in countries with higher GDP per capita: 20.86%
Average tax revenue percentage in countries with lower GDP per capita: 10.88%
Average total tax rate percentage in countries with higher GDP per capita: 31.91%

Note 1: Life expectancy in countries with the highest GDP per capita is, on average, 20 years higher than in countries with the lowest GDP.

Note 2: CPI in countries with higher GDP in the range of 100 to 120, while countries with lower
GDP has a wider range, from 100 to 1344 in Sudan's case.

Note 3: An interesting fact is that countries with lower levels of GDP per capita
have an average unemployment rate lower than the average unemployment rate of countries with higher levels of
GDP per capita.

Note 4: We observe that countries with higher GDP per capita capture almost twice as much taxes as countries
with lower GDP per capita.

Note 5: Countries with higher per capita GDP have lower corporate tax levels,
while countries with lower GDP per capita have lower levels of corporate taxes.

Note 6: Another thing we can observe is that most of the countries with the lowest GDP per capita are
located in the African continent, while the countries with the highest GDP are mainly in Europe/West.
