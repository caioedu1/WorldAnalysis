# GLOBAL INDEX: A DATA ANALYSIS OF MANY GLOBAL INDICATORS
#### Video Demo:  <URL HERE> -> not recorded yet
#### Description:
The project consists of data analysis using Python and some additional libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Plotly. Data analysis is done on top of a data frame that contains several countries in the world and some environmental, human, and economic development indices.

In dataanalysis.py, the goal is to extract some information. There are two "sections" in dataanalysis.py; the first one seeks to get some information and pass it to the "analysis.txt" file. The second seeks to create some graphs with some information using the Matplotlib and Plotly libraries.

In create_index.py, the goal is to create an index that seeks to determine whether a country is good to live in or not. It takes into account social, economic, and environmental indices.

In functions.py, there are two functions. The first serves to send an automatic email containing the graphs created in dataanalysis.py. The second has the function of cleaning the data frame, such as by renaming column names, passing values to numbers, and removing unnecessary lines that disturb the general analysis of the data, such as adding some new columns based on operations, among others. .

This project was created with the purpose of showing my skills in data analysis. It wasn't designed for anyone else to use besides me. Furthermore, all information is based on an online data frame, so the extracted data should not be taken as fully true in a real-world context.
