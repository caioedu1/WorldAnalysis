# GLOBAL INDEX: A DATA ANALYSIS OF MANY GLOBAL INDICATORS
#### Video Demo:  <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2-A9Mtk6vs>
#### Description:
The project consists of data analysis using Python and some additional libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Plotly. Data analysis is done on top of a data frame that contains several countries in the world and some environmental, human, and economic development indices. 

Within the "dataanalysis.py" script, the objective is to derive information. The script comprises two distinct sections: the initial one is focused on extracting data and transferring it to the "analysis.txt" file, while the subsequent section aims to generate graphical representations using the Matplotlib and Plotly libraries. These generated plots are automatically stored within the "plot_figs" directory, which serves as a repository for all plots destined for Google Drive storage and subsequent sharing via email.

The primary goal of the "create_index.py" script is to establish an index that assesses the suitability of different countries for habitation. This assessment takes into account various social, economic, and environmental metrics. It's crucial to emphasize that this index is designed to be impartial and free from personal biases or opinions regarding specific countries or types of countries. It should be understood that this index may not provide a wholly accurate representation within a real-world context, as creating a truly comprehensive analysis would require much greater complexity and consideration of additional cultural factors, which can vary significantly among individuals. It's important to keep in mind that the main objective of this entire project is to showcase my data analysis skills.

In the "functions.py" file, you will find two distinct functions. The first function is responsible for automating the process of sending emails using the pywin32 library. It includes the attachment of graphs generated in the "dataanalysis.py" script. The primary purpose of this function is to streamline the email-sending process and ensure that the generated graphs are included as attachments. The second function in "functions.py" serves to preprocess the data frame. This involves several tasks such as renaming column names for clarity, converting values to numerical formats when necessary, and removing extraneous rows that might interfere with the overall data analysis. Additionally, this function can add new columns to the data frame as required. Its primary objective is to prepare the data for subsequent analysis by cleaning, transforming, and enhancing it as needed.

This project was created with the purpose of showing my skills in data analysis. It wasn't designed for anyone else to use besides me. Furthermore, all information is based on an online data frame, so the extracted data should not be taken as fully true in a real-world context.
